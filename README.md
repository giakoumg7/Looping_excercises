Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0
to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current
number is odd or even, and display a message to
the screen.
● Rewrite the following code segment using a while
loop, do while loop
sum = 0;
for (x = 1; x <= 10; x++) {
sum += Math.pow(x,2);
}

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For
each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the
number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
● Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every
multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
● Write a JavaScript program which iterates the
integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three
print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the
multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which
are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz".
