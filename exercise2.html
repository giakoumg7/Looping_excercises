    <title>Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the
        number by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18"). ● Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every
        multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total). ● Write a JavaScript program which iterates the integers from 1 to
        100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
        For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</title>
